# wasm-libc

Some generic libc bindings in rust

## Description

Basic, filesystem-related ["libc"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library) bindings for rust, specifically tailored to WebAssembly (wasm32-unknown-unknown) compilation

Can be used with [wasm-vfs](https://github.com/dphilla/wasm-vfs) for (very basic) Wasm-first file i/o operations 

**Not for production use - use at own risk (expect many, many bugs ðŸ«£)**
